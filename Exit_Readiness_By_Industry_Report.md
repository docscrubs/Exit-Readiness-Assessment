# Exit Readiness Requirements by Industry Sector

## Minimum Levels for UK SME Transactions

**Research Report – January 2026**

---

## Executive Summary

This report analyses minimum exit readiness requirements across six UK industry sectors and three company stages (pre-revenue, £5m valuation, £30m valuation). The analysis synthesises data from authoritative UK M&A sources to provide SME owners with sector-specific guidance on preparation requirements.

### Key Findings

1. **Technology and Healthcare sectors require highest baseline readiness** – Level 2.0 minimum even for pre-revenue companies due to IP complexity and regulatory requirements

2. **Private equity buyers add approximately +0.5 to minimum requirements** compared to trade buyers across all sectors

3. **ESG requirements have become material** – 71% of UK PE buyers now prioritise ESG in transactions (KPMG 2024)

4. **Size premium correlates with readiness expectations** – Companies with £5m EBITDA attract 89% higher multiples than those with £200k EBITDA, with proportionally higher preparation standards expected

5. **Critical domains vary by sector** – SME owners should prioritise sector-specific critical domains rather than spreading effort evenly

## Buyer Type Impact

### Readiness Level Adjustments

| Buyer Type | Adjustment | Rationale |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| Trade Buyer | -0.5 | Sector knowledge reduces DD requirements |
| Private Equity | +0.5 | Rigorous financial focus, IC requirements |
| Listed Company | +0.5 | Disclosure requirements, shareholder scrutiny |

### Due Diligence Characteristics by Buyer Type

| Factor | Trade Buyer | Private Equity | Listed Company |
|--------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Typical DD Duration | 4-8 weeks | 8-12 weeks | 10-16 weeks |
| DD Question Volume | 200-400 | 500-800 | 400-600 |
| Vendor DD Value | Helpful | Strongly recommended | Often required |
| Synergy Premium | 10-30% | Rare | 5-15% |
| Earn-out Frequency | 30-40% | 50-70% | 20-30% |
| Management Retention | 12-24 months | 3-5 years | 12-24 months |

### Adjusted Minimum Requirements (£5m Valuation Example)

| Industry | Trade | PE | Listed |
|----------|-------|-----|--------|
| Technology/SaaS | 2.0 | 3.0 | 3.0 |
| Healthcare | 2.0 | 3.0 | 3.0 |
| Professional Services | 1.5 | 2.5 | 2.5 |
| Manufacturing | 1.5 | 2.5 | 2.5 |
| Construction/Engineering | 1.5 | 2.5 | 2.5 |
| Retail/Hospitality | 1.5 | 2.5 | 2.5 |

## Additional Factors

### Size Premium Effect

| EBITDA Range | Typical Multiple | DD Intensity | Minimum Readiness |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| <£500k | 3.8-4.5x | Light | Level 1.5 |
| £500k-£1.5m | 4.5-5.5x | Standard | Level 2.0 |
| £1.5m-£3m | 5.5-6.5x | Comprehensive | Level 2.5 |
| £3m-£6m+ | 6.5-7.5x+ | Full vendor DD expected | Level 3.0+ |

**Finding:** The 89% multiple premium from £200k to £5m EBITDA correlates with proportionally higher readiness requirements.

### ESG Considerations

- 71% of UK investors now prioritise ESG in transactions (KPMG 2024)
- 57% expect ESG DD on most deals within 2 years
- Elevates ESG & Risk domain requirements across all sectors
- Level 2 minimum effectively required for institutional buyers

### Tax Changes (2025-2026)

- Business Asset Disposal Relief (BADR) rate increasing: 10% → 14% (April 2025) → 18% (April 2026)
- Driving earlier exit preparation
- Companies targeting April 2026 completion should begin readiness improvement 18-24 months in advance

### National Security and Investment Act 2021 (NSIA)

- Applies to SMEs in 17 sensitive sectors (AI, data infrastructure, communications, defence)
- Mandatory notification for acquisitions of 25%+ shareholding/voting rights
- Add +0.5 to Legal & Corporate and ESG & Risk domains for affected sectors
- Failure to notify can render deal void with civil/criminal sanctions

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### For SME Owners

1. **Identify likely buyer type(s)** and adjust minimum targets accordingly
2. **Prioritise critical domains** for your sector—don't spread effort evenly
3. **Address any Level 0 domains immediately**—these are potential deal-breakers
4. **Allow 12-18 months** to move from Level 1 to Level 3 (typical improvement rate)
5. **Consider vendor DD investment** for transactions >£10m—accelerates process and builds buyer confidence

### Key Insight

A "one size fits all" approach to exit preparation is insufficient. SME owners should calibrate readiness efforts to their specific circumstances: industry sector, company stage, and target buyer type.
