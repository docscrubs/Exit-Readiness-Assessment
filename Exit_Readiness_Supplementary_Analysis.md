## B. Critical Domain Thresholds by Industry

Certain domains are "critical" for specific industries—where falling below the minimum level is likely to be transaction-fatal or result in significant value destruction.

| Industry | Critical Domain(s) | Min Level | Why Critical |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Technology/SaaS | Legal & Corporate | Level 2 | IP chain of title essential; code ownership disputes can invalidate entire deal |
| Technology/SaaS | Operational | Level 2 | Architecture documentation required for integration planning; tech debt quantification |
| Healthcare | ESG & Risk | Level 2 | CQC rating non-negotiable; "Requires Improvement" typically transaction-fatal |
| Healthcare | People & Organisation | Level 2 | Staff registrations, DBS compliance, fit & proper persons declarations |
| Professional Services | Commercial | Level 2 | Client concentration >30% creates unacceptable key client risk |
| Professional Services | People & Organisation | Level 2 | Key person risk; fee earner retention critical to revenue sustainability |
| Manufacturing | Operational | Level 2 | Equipment condition and capex requirements directly impact valuation |
| Manufacturing | ESG & Risk | Level 2 | Environmental liability can exceed transaction value; contamination risk |
| Construction/Eng. | Financial | Level 2 | Revenue recognition on long-term contracts; WIP valuation critical |
| Construction/Eng. | ESG & Risk | Level 1 | H&S record non-negotiable; CDM compliance essential |
| Retail/Hospitality | Legal & Corporate | Level 2 | Lease portfolio analysis essential; break clauses and dilapidations |
| Retail/Hospitality | Financial | Level 2 | Seasonality analysis required; occupancy cost ratio critical |

## C. Comparison: VC Due Diligence vs Exit Readiness

Analysis of the VC Due Diligence Checklist reveals that having compliance documentation alone (typical VC checklist items) achieves only Level 2-3 readiness. The gap exists in forward-looking, buyer-focused preparation elements.

### C.1 VC Checklist Coverage vs Exit Readiness Levels

| VC Checklist Area | Level Achieved | Gap to Level 3 | Missing Elements |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Corporate Structure & Records | Level 2-3 | 0-1 | Disclosure letter drafting, consent matrix |
| Share Capital & Shareholders | Level 3 | 0 | Generally complete for exit purposes |
| Accounts & Financials | Level 2 | 1 | Normalised EBITDA, QoE analysis, locked-box |
| Finance & Banking | Level 2 | 1 | Working capital analysis, debt mechanics |
| Contracts & Trading | Level 2 | 1 | Change of control clause analysis |
| Assets | Level 2 | 1 | Valuation for locked-box, clean title |
| Intellectual Property | Level 2-3 | 0-1 | Freedom to operate opinion |
| Insurance | Level 2 | 1 | W&I insurance readiness pack |
| Compliance & Consents | Level 2 | 1 | Regulatory notification requirements |
| Litigation | Level 2-3 | 0-1 | Warranty exposure quantification |
| Employment | Level 2 | 1 | Retention packages, TUPE readiness |
| Pensions | Level 2 | 1-2 | Independent valuation (if DB scheme) |
| Real Estate | Level 2 | 1 | Landlord consent strategy, dilapidations |
| Environment | Level 1-2 | 1-2 | Phase 1 assessment, contamination survey |
| Health & Safety | Level 2 | 1 | Audit trail, incident trend analysis |
| Tax | Level 2 | 1-2 | Tax clearances, transfer pricing docs |

### Key Finding

A company with complete VC due diligence documentation achieves approximately **Level 2-2.5 average readiness**. The additional 0.5-1.5 levels required for optimal exit readiness come from transaction-specific preparation:

- Normalised EBITDA analysis
- Buyer-focused analytics (cohort analysis, LTV/CAC)
- Consent matrices
- Vendor DD reports
- Change of control clause identification
- W&I insurance preparation

## D. Typical Time Required to Achieve Target Readiness

The time required to improve readiness depends on starting position, available resources, and target level.

| Starting Level | Target Level | Typical Timeline | Key Dependencies |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Level 0 (Incomplete) | Level 2 (Managed) | 18-24 months | Systems implementation, documentation |
| Level 1 (Initial) | Level 2 (Managed) | 9-15 months | Process documentation, gap remediation |
| Level 1 (Initial) | Level 3 (Defined) | 15-24 months | Audit preparation, analytics build |
| Level 2 (Managed) | Level 3 (Defined) | 6-12 months | Normalisation, self-assessment |
| Level 2 (Managed) | Level 4 (Optimised) | 12-18 months | Vendor DD, third-party verification |
| Level 3 (Defined) | Level 4 (Optimised) | 3-6 months | Vendor DD engagement, final polish |

### D.1 Cost Considerations

Readiness improvement involves both internal effort and external advisory costs.

| Service | Typical Cost Range | When Required |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Exit planning advisory (M&A advisor) | £10,000-£30,000 | Starting Level 0-1 |
| Vendor Financial Due Diligence | £30,000-£80,000 | £5m+ valuation, PE buyers |
| Vendor Commercial Due Diligence | £25,000-£60,000 | £10m+ valuation |
| Legal DD preparation | £15,000-£50,000 | Complex structures, IP-heavy |
| IT/Technology DD | £15,000-£40,000 | Technology companies |
| ESG assessment | £10,000-£30,000 | PE buyers, manufacturing |
| Environmental Phase 1 | £3,000-£10,000 per site | Manufacturing, property-heavy |

## E. Domain Priority Matrix by Industry

Not all domains carry equal weight for each industry. This matrix helps prioritise improvement efforts (1 = highest priority, 6 = lowest priority).

| Domain | Tech | Healthcare | Prof Svcs | Manufacturing | Construction | Retail |
|--------|------|------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Financial | 2 | 3 | 2 | 2 | **1** | **1** |
| Legal & Corporate | **1** | **1** | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 |
| Commercial | 3 | 4 | **1** | 4 | 2 | 3 |
| Operational | 2 | 2 | 5 | **1** | 2 | 4 |
| People & Organisation | 4 | 2 | **1** | 5 | 4 | 5 |
| ESG & Risk | 5 | **1** | 6 | **1** | 2 | 6 |

**Note:** Bold indicates highest priority domain(s) for each industry. Priority 1 = Critical, address first; Priority 6 = Important but can be addressed later.

### Interpretation

- **Technology:** Legal & Corporate (IP ownership) is critical; Operational (architecture) close second
- **Healthcare:** ESG & Risk (CQC rating) and Legal & Corporate (registration) are non-negotiable
- **Professional Services:** Commercial (client relationships) and People (fee earners) drive value
- **Manufacturing:** Operational (equipment) and ESG (environmental) are both Priority 1
- **Construction:** Financial (revenue recognition) is critical; ESG (H&S) close second
- **Retail:** Financial (seasonality) is critical; Legal (leases) second priority

## F. Summary: Quick Reference Guide

**Use this quick reference when assessing exit readiness requirements:**

1. **Identify your industry sector** and company stage (pre-revenue, £5m, £30m valuation tier)

2. **Determine likely buyer type** and apply adjustment:
   - Trade buyer: -0.5
   - Private equity: +0.5
   - Listed company: +0.5

3. **Identify critical domains** for your industry (see Section B and E above)

4. **Self-assess current levels** using the SME Sale Readiness Self-Assessment Matrix

5. **Calculate the gap** between current and required minimum levels

6. **Estimate timeline** using Section D guidance

7. **Prioritise improvement efforts** on critical domains first

8. **Consider vendor DD** for transactions >£10m or PE buyers
