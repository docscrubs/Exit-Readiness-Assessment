# Indicative Valuation Methodology

This document explains how the SME Exit Readiness Assessment calculates indicative business valuations. This methodology is provided for transparency and educational purposes.

## 1. Introduction

This indicative valuation uses market-based approaches common in SME transactions:

- Based on **EBITDA multiples** or **revenue multiples** depending on data available
- Adjusted for business characteristics that affect buyer perception
- Converts Enterprise Value to Equity Value by deducting debt

**Important:** This is an indicative estimate only, not a professional valuation. Actual transaction values depend on market conditions, buyer synergies, deal structure, negotiation, and comprehensive due diligence. A qualified valuation professional should be engaged before any transaction.

## 2. Base Valuation Methods

### EBITDA Multiple Method (Preferred)

**Formula:** Enterprise Value = Normalised EBITDA × Industry Multiple

- **EBITDA** (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortisation) or **Profit** can be used as the earnings base
- **Normalised** = average of available years to smooth fluctuations
- This is the standard approach for established businesses with reliable profit data

### Revenue Multiple Method (Fallback)

**Formula:** Enterprise Value = Annual Turnover × Revenue Multiple

- Used when profitability data is unavailable for smaller businesses (turnover under £3M)
- Less accurate as it doesn't account for profitability differences between businesses
- Appropriate for early-stage or high-growth businesses where profits are reinvested

## 3. Multiple Ranges by Business Type

| Business Type | EBITDA Multiple | Revenue Multiple | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Service Business** | 2x - 4x | 0.5x - 1.0x | Lower capital intensity, higher labour dependency, relationship-driven |
| **Product Business** | 3x - 6x | 0.8x - 1.5x | Asset base, inventory value, manufacturing scalability |
| **Tech/SaaS** | 4x - 10x | 1.0x - 2.0x | High scalability, recurring revenue potential, IP value, lower marginal costs |

### Why Different Multiples?

**Service businesses** typically trade at lower multiples because:
- Revenue depends heavily on key personnel
- Harder to scale without proportional cost increases
- Customer relationships may not transfer easily

**Product businesses** command mid-range multiples because:
- Physical assets and inventory have tangible value
- Manufacturing processes can be scaled
- Brand value often transfers with the business

**Tech/SaaS businesses** attract higher multiples because:
- Software can scale with minimal additional cost
- Recurring subscription revenue is predictable
- Intellectual property creates defensible value
- High gross margins (typically 65-80%)

## 4. Adjustment Factors

### Customer Concentration

| Concentration Level | Adjustment | Description |
|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| **High** (>40% from one customer) | -20% to -30% discount | Significant revenue risk if key customer leaves |
| **Medium** (20-40% from one customer) | -10% to -15% discount | Moderate concentration risk |
| **Low** (<20% from any customer) | No adjustment | Well-diversified customer base |

**Rationale:** High customer concentration increases revenue risk. Buyers apply discounts because losing a key customer could dramatically impact the business. This is one of the most significant factors in SME valuations.

### Recurring Revenue

| Recurring Revenue % | Adjustment | Description |
|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| **>70%** | +15% premium | Highly predictable revenue stream |
| **50-70%** | +5% to +10% premium | Good revenue visibility |
| **<50%** | No adjustment | Project-based or transactional revenue |

**Rationale:** Predictable, contractual revenue reduces risk and supports higher valuations. Subscription or retainer-based models command significant premiums because:
- Easier to forecast future performance
- Lower customer acquisition costs (retention vs. new sales)
- Higher lifetime value per customer

### Growth Trend

| Growth Trend | Adjustment | Description |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| **Growing** (>10% YoY) | +10% to +15% premium | Momentum attracts buyers |
| **Flat** | No adjustment | Stable but not exciting |
| **Declining** | -15% to -20% discount | Higher risk, turnaround required |

**Rationale:** Growth trajectory significantly impacts buyer willingness to pay. Growing businesses demonstrate market demand and operational capability. Declining businesses require turnaround investment and carry execution risk.

### Company Size (EBITDA-Based)

| EBITDA Level | Multiple Position | Rationale |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **<£500K** | Lower end of range | Higher risk, key person dependency, limited buyer pool |
| **£500K - £2M** | Mid-range | Established operations, growing buyer interest |
| **>£2M** | Higher end of range | Institutional interest, management depth, proven scalability |

**Rationale:** Larger businesses command higher multiples due to:
- Reduced key person risk
- More robust management structures
- Larger pool of potential buyers (including PE firms)
- Better negotiating position in transactions

Industry data shows significant size premiums: businesses with £200K EBITDA average 3.1x multiples, while those with £10M EBITDA average 8.5x (Source: First Page Sage 2025).

## 5. Enterprise Value to Equity Value

**Formula:** Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Total Debt

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Enterprise Value (EV)** | The value of the operating business to all stakeholders |
| **Total Debt** | All financial liabilities including loans, overdrafts, finance leases, and other borrowings |
| **Equity Value** | What the owner receives after debt repayment - the "take-home" amount |

### Why This Matters

When you sell a business, the buyer typically:
1. Pays the **Enterprise Value** for the operating business
2. Either assumes the debt or requires it to be paid off at completion
3. The seller receives the **Equity Value** (EV minus debt)

**Example:**
- Enterprise Value: £3,000,000
- Total Debt: £500,000
- Equity Value: £2,500,000 (what the owner receives)

## 6. Confidence Levels

The confidence level indicates how reliable the valuation estimate is based on data quality:

| Confidence | Data Requirements |
|------------|-------------------|
| **High** | 3+ years historical data, all optional adjustments provided, consistent financials |
| **Medium** | 1-2 years data, some adjustment factors provided |
| **Low** | Minimal data, significant estimation required, missing key factors |

**How to improve confidence:**
- Provide more years of historical financial data
- Complete all optional adjustment fields
- Use EBITDA rather than just turnover

## 7. Important Caveats

This indicative valuation should be used for guidance only. Key limitations include:

### What This Methodology Does NOT Account For:

- **Specific deal terms** - Earn-outs, deferred consideration, vendor financing
- **Working capital adjustments** - Normal vs. actual working capital at completion
- **Minority/control premiums** - Different values for different ownership stakes
- **Synergies** - Strategic buyers may pay premiums for specific combinations
- **Market timing** - M&A market conditions vary significantly
- **Comparable transactions** - Specific recent deals in your sector
- **Asset values** - Property, equipment, or other specific assets
- **Intellectual property** - Patents, trademarks, proprietary technology
- **Employee/management factors** - Key person risk, retention arrangements

### When to Seek Professional Advice:

We strongly recommend engaging professional advisors when:
- Considering an actual transaction
- Valuation exceeds £1M
- Complex ownership structures exist
- Significant intangible assets are involved
- Tax planning is required
- Multiple potential buyers are expected
